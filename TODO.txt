Warm up with a usage narrative:

    A usage narrative:

        It's a situated example (an example in a particular living situation) of the use case in operation
            - a single, highly specific example of an actor using the system
            - it's not a use case

        It will help to:
            - envision the system in use
            - warm up before writing a use case, to work through the details
            - set the stage for more detailed and generalized descriptions of the requirements
            - anchor the use case 
                + the use case itself will be a formula (dried up form of the usage narrative)


    Sketch out a vignette:
        i.e. a few moments in the day of the life of one of the actors

        # invent a fictional but specific actor (complete with a name etc.)
        # briefly capture the mental state state of that person
            - why he wants what he wants
            - what conditions drive him to act as he does
        # don't write much
        # capture how the world works, from the start of the situation to the end
        # be brief so the reader can get the story at a glance
        # emotional content (details and motives) are important 



Write use cases

    # low-precision (so details are added later)
        it's important to get a list of correct[!] use cases
    # not using very many words
    # name the use cases as "user goals"
        the list shows/announces what the new system will be/do
            reveals the scope of the system, its purpose in life
            becomes a communication device between the different stakeholders on the project
            is a framework to which to attach
                complexity
                cost
                timing 
                status

    # Show the list to the stakeholders / users of the system
    # have the users fine-tune or reject the stories
        which functions get built first
        how the teams are to be set up



    SAVE YOUR ENERGY! STRONGLY RECOMMENDED ORDER:
        Four stages/levels of precision in writing use cases

        1) Actors and goals (easy)

            # list what actors and which of their goals the system will support
            # review  this list for accuraccy and completeness
            # prioritize and assign goals to teams and releases

        2) Use case brief or main success scenario (easy)

            # sketch the main success scenario for the use cases you have selected to pursue
            # review them in draft form to make sure that the system really is delivering the interests of the stakeholders you care about

        3) Failure conditions (harder)

            # complete the main success scenario
            # do failure brainstorming
                - draft a list of all the failures that can occur
                - make sure it's complete


        4)  failure handlings (tricky, tiring, surprising work)
                work out and write how the system must handle failures / respond to each failure
                    Surprise! as you discover
                        - an obscure business rule
                        - a new actor
                        - a new stakeholder
                        - a new goal
