Problem statement.

    The problem of 

        lack of medium to 
        save and provide language translations for 
        such volatile but self-existent units of speech as 
        winged words and phrases that are present in different languages and cultures
        and that are significant carriers of the contemporary culture of different people groups  

    affects

        mutual understanding between people of different nations and cultures

    the impact of which is

        language and culture barriers 
            hampering mutual understanding between nations and cultures and
            contributing to inter-racial, inter-ethnic and inter-cultural tensions in the society.

    A successful solution would

        help overcome the language and culture barriers and shocks
        by providing an open-end[?] online public database for the continuous process of 

            (1) saving winged words from different languages and cultures
            (2) providing adequate translations for the winged words into different languages
            (3) querying the entries while doing translation work or studying
