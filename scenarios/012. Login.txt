=======================================================

012. User wants to create a new entry
    The possible information the user has are the following:
        A: an original phrase and a Russian translation
            e.g. the En text of the "Happy Birthday" song with a Ru transl
        B: an original phrase without a translation
            e.g. the En text of the "Happy Birthday" song without a transl
        C: a translation of a phrase, without the text in the original language
            e.g. the En text of the "Are you sleeping" song without a transl
        D: a phrase which the user doesn't know a translation or the original
        E: the OL in which to create the new entry for the phrase e.g. English
        F: the text of the phrase in the OL like the En text of the "Happy Birthday" song
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. User asks the system to let him create an entry
    1. System asks the user to give what information he has: A, B, C, or D

        .1 User gives A:
            .1 System asks the user to give E and F:

                .1 User gives both E and F
                    .1 System makes a search of the db in the OL here: English to see whether an entry with the same text already exists in the database. 
                        .1 system finds nothing
                        .2 system finds ...
                .2 User gives E, omits F
                .3 User omits E, gives F
                .4 User omits both E and F

        .2 User gives B:
            .1 System asks the user to give E and F
                .1 User gives both E and F
                .2 User gives E, omits F
                .3 User omits E, gives F
                .4 User omits both E and F

        .3 User gives C:
            .1 System asks the user to give E and F
                .1 User gives both E and F
                    .1 System checks to see if an entry with the same text already exists in the database.
                        .1 System finds a match
                        .2 System finds no match

        .4 User gives D:
            .1 System asks the user to give E and F
                    .1 System checks to see if an entry with the same text already exists in the database.
                        .1 System finds a match
                        .2 System finds no match


// We need use this sub-scenario at some point:
    .1 user wants to edit the entry he has just made
        .1 User selects the entry to be edited
        .2 User asks the system to let him edit it
            .1 System opens the entry for editing
                .1 User edits the entry
                .2 User wants to save it
                .3 System asks User to confirm saving
                .4 User confirms saving
                .5 System saves the entry
                .6 System displays the result.
