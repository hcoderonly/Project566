// Risks 1-4 is by Lily

Risk 1
    
    Description: 
        inadequate health and medical surveillance
        Small kids can carry the viruses and spread to others easily and quickly. The poor management on health risk would keep the clients away from the business. 

    Mitigation:
        Health risk can be minimized by proactive policy. Make a clear sick-kids policy will keep the kids healthy.
        Staff should include a doctor or a nurse that can provide first aid measures.


Risk 2
    
    Description:
        Employee risk
        The staff-to-child ratio is different depending on the ages of the children. And the director of each site may have more specific requirement. Always keeping the staff-to-child ratio and meeting the regulation are the challenges. 

    Mitigation:
        Implementing a computing system to manage the staff schedules will greatly reduce the risks.
        And considerable staff hiring policy will be also helpful to reduce the risks fundamentally.

Risk 3
    
    Description:
        Safety risk
        Keeping children safe is always the big risk for a day care. The safeties for both outdoor activities and indoor activities are important.
        Facilities are not child proof enough (furniture, electrical outlets etc.)

    Mitigation:
        Careful location selection and well-constructed play-ground will keep children safe in outdoor activities.
        And proper toys, room decoration and furniture will enhance the safety for the indoor activity.
        Child-proof the furniture and electrical outlets
    
Risk 4
    
    Description: 
        Communication and trust risk
        Day care centers need to keep good communications with parents and gain their trust. Otherwise they will lose the clients

    Mitigation:
        A reporting system will help to minimize the risks.
        And the computing system for registration and payment processing will be helpful as well.
